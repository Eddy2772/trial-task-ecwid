================

Completing this simple task will prove that you have minimal set of skills required for our project.

Do the following:

1. Set up a very simple PHP-based site which will be loaded from 3 different .php files: header.php, body.php, and footer.php.

2. The side should contain an Ecwid shop inside of a bootstrap accordion.

3. One of Ecwid products should be a football ball.

4. Load the site to any free hosting, preferrably to openshift.com

5. Make a pull request to this repository containing a link to the site.
